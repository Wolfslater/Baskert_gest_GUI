Remember, do not modify the files content as the files are stored in public repos, unless told so by ME.
The updated version is gest_cest_GUI. I repeat DO NOT MODIFY THE .PY CONTENT, I CAN SEE YOUR COMMITS.

The repos contain different .py used to recreate a management of fruit basket via tkinter library.
The files wich make use of tkinter are: mainGUI.py, GUIManagement.py, basketManager.py, addFruit.py.
The file Baskets makes use of the class Cestino to buid 5 different baskets in wich the fruits can be stored
